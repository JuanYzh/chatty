# chatty

## A chat application based on the chatGPT API.

### Features include:
1. A visual interface;
2. Switching models, including gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4;
3. Default scenario settings, i.e., the default behavior of the model;
4. Custom maximum tokens (the model itself has a maximum limit of 4096).

### I will also challenge the following features:
1. Multi-modal (only available with gpt-4 API key), i.e., support for input such as images;
2. Image output (markdown).

I plan to complete it within a few weeks. In fact, if I choose a development framework that I am familiar with, it will
be fast, because I have already completed the communication with the openai-api,
and it can return responses correctly. But I think that always developing in 
my familiar field is not challenging and very boring, so I plan to deepen my 
study of frameworks that I have never used before. Wish me good luck!
